### Dataset Summary

This is the official dataset used to train general robot manipulation agents with multimodal prompts, as presented in [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03094). It contains 650K trajectories for 13 tasks in [VIMA-Bench](https://github.com/vimalabs/VimaBench). All demonstrations are generated by oracles.

## Dataset Structure

There are three major fields in each data sample: `observation`, `action`, and `multimodal_instruction` as well as its asset `multimodal_instruction_assets`.
The field `observation` stores agents' observations, including visual observations (RGB and matched segmentation) from frontal and top-down views and the type of the end-effector.
The field `action` stores ground-truth action labels. Here we use two high-level primitive actions ("pick-and-place" and "sweep"). Each action label consists of the starting and ending poses for these two primitives.
Fields `multimodal_instruction` and `multimodal_instruction_assets` store multi-modal prompts (interleaved texts and images).
More details and examples can be found [here](https://github.com/vimalabs/VimaBench#training-data).

## Dataset Creation

All demonstrations are generated by scripted oracles.

## Visualization
Here we visualize two trajectories with their multi-modal prompts from tasks "Visual Goal Reaching: Rearrange then Restore" and "Visual Constraint Satisfaction: Without Touching".
